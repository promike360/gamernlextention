# Gamer.nl Review Redesign
By ProMike360<br><br>


#Extention information
Changes the position of the review score from Top on the page to the Bottom on gamer.nl

`!! This extention is only for Google Chrome !!`

#Read the code
You can read the code that is used in this extention in `Script.js`

#How to use
Because of how the website of gamer.nl is being loaded, i needed to let the code wait for 3sec before it will be activated.
If this will not be done, the information that the code needs to have is not yet loaded/showen. I could not find an other way to recieve the data and edit it. If you know a way around, let me know.

#Download
`Mediafire` http://www.mediafire.com/download/e9l9a9lb604ipvb/GamerNL_ReviewRedesign.crx<br>
`Mega` https://mega.nz/#!cwl3RILQ!a_16Wh_kRhxIN-16QV82dIz1qGRi2vW33CvcNgI84o0

#How to install
Go into `Google Chrome` => `Settings` => `Extentions`
Here you can drag the file you downloaded into chrome and drop it. It will ask you to install, press `Add Extention`.
You are done :)

#Other
It's a simple extention, but it can improve your reading experience.

Hope you like it!
